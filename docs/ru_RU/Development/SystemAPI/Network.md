## üåè Web Interface API

The following APIs provide the basic network interface for scripts.
If there are more complex needs, the network library of the respective language platform can be used to complete the task.

### Send an Asynchronous HTTP(s) Get Request  

`network.httpGet(url,callback)`

- Parameters: 
  - url : `String`  
    The target address of the request (including the parameters attached to the Get request).
  - callback : `Function`  
    The callback function to execute when the request returns, to return the HTTP(s) response result.
- Return value: Whether the request was successfully sent.
- Return value type: `Boolean`

Note: The prototype of the callback function of the parameter callback: `function(status,result)`  

- status : `Integer`    
  The returned HTTP(s) response code, such as 200 means the request was successful.
- result : `String`  
  The returned data.

If the request fails, the status value will be `-1`. 

<br>

### Send an Asynchronous HTTP(s) Post Request  

`network.httpPost(url,data,type,callback)`

- Parameters: 
  - url : `String`  
    The destination address of the request.
  - data : `String`  
    The data being sent.
  - type : `String`  
    The Post data type sent, in the form of `text/plain` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  - callback : `Function`  
    The callback function to execute when the request returns, to return the HTTP(s) response result.
- Return value: Whether the request was successfully sent.
- Return value type: `Boolean`

Note: The prototype of the callback function of the parameter callback: `function(status,result)`  

- status : `Integer`    
  The returned HTTP(s) response code, such as 200 means the request was successful.
- result : `String`  
  The returned data.

If the request fails, the status value will be `-1`.

## üîå WebSocket Client Object API

In LLSE, use "WebSocket objects" to manipulate the connection and work of a WebSocket client.

### Create a New WebSocket Client Object 

[JS] `new WSClient()`  
[Lua] `WSClient()`

- Return value: A new WebSocket client object.
- Return value type: `WSClient`

<br>

### WebSocket Client Object - Properties

Every WS client object contains some fixed object properties. for a specific file object `wsc`, has the following properties:

| Attributes | Meaning        | Data Type   |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------ |
| wsc.status | Current Connection Status | `Enum` |

These object properties are read-only and cannot be modified.

Among them, the wsc.status enumeration has the following situations:

`wsc.Open` - In normal connection.  
`wsc.Closing` - Disconnecting.  
`wsc.Closed` - Not connected.

<br>

### WebSocket Client Object - Function

Every WS client object contains some member functions (member methods) that can be executed. for a specific file object `wsc`, you can perform some operations on this client through the following functions.

#### Create a Connection

`wsc.connect(target)`

- Parameter: 
  - target : `String`  
    The destination address to connect to, in the form of `ws://hostname[:port][/path/path][?query=value]`
- Return value: Whether the connection is successful.
- Return value type: `Boolean` 

<br>

#### Create a Connection Asynchronously

`wsc.connectAsync(target,callback)`

- Parameters: 
  - target : `String`  
    The destination address to connect to, in the form of `ws://hostname[:port][/path/path][?query=value]`
  - callback : `Function`
    A callback function to execute when the connection succeeds or fails.
- Return value: Whether the connection attempt was started successfully or not.
- Return value type: `Boolean` 

Note: The prototype of the callback function of the parameter callback: `function(success)`  

- success : `Boolean`    
  Whether the WebSocket connection is successful 

<br>

#### Send Text/Binary Messages

`wsc.send(msg)`

- Parameter: 
  - msg : `String` / `ByteBuffer`  
    Text/Binary data to send.
- Return value: Whether it was sent successfully.
- Return value type: `Boolean` 

If the parameter type passed in is `String`, will be sent as text, if it is `ByteBuffer` will be sent as binary data.

<br>

#### Listen for WebSocket Events 

In the process of WS working, when a message is received or an error occurs, the relevant information needs to be processed. Here is the interface for listening to events.

`wsc.listen(event,callback)`

- Parameters: 

  - event : `String`  
    The name of the event to listen for (see the list of listening events below).

  - callback : `Functon`  
    Registered listener function (see below for function-related parameters)
    When the specified event occurs, LLSE will call the listener function you gave and pass in the corresponding parameters.
- Return value: Whether the event was successfully monitored.
- Return value type: `Boolean` 

<br>

#### List of Listening Events

##### `"onTextReceived"` - Listen for string messages.

- Listener function prototype
  `function(msg)`
- Parameter: 
  - msg : `String`  
    Received string message.

##### `"onBinaryReceived"` - Listen for binary messages.

- Listener function prototype 
  `function(data)`
- Parameter: 
  - data : `ByteBuffer`  
    Received binary message.

##### `"onError"` - Listen for errors.

- Listener function prototype 
  `function(msg)`
- Parameter: 
  - msg : `String`  
    Error message.

##### `"onLostConnection"` - Listen for lost connections.

- Listener function prototype 
  `function(code)`
- Parameter: 
  - code : `Integer`  
    Error code.

<br>

#### Close the Connection

`wsc.close()`

- Return value: Whether the connection was successfully closed.
- Return value type: `Boolean` 

Do not continue to use this client object while it is closed!

<br>

#### Force Disconnect

`wsc.shutdown()`

- Return value: Whether the connection was successfully disconnected.
- Return value type: `Boolean` 

Do not continue to use this client object while it is disconnected!

<br>

#### Get Error Code

`wsc.errorCode()`

- Return value: The error code generated by the last error.
- Return value type: `Integer`

If you encounter a failure in the use of the above interface, you can get the last error code from here.
