## ðŸ’° Economic System API

In many servers, the economic system is a very critical part.  
In order to solve various problems of traditional use of the scoreboard economic system, LLSE provides an interface to connect to the LLMoney economic system, which can communicate with other series of plugins. 

In addition to the capabilities of the traditional economic system, LLMoney also has additional capabilities such as querying the history of changes in the amount and operating the economy of offline players.  
LiteLoader is installed with the LLMoney plugin, so you can use this interface directly without additional installation. 

Note: In order to operate the wallets of offline players, the economic system interface uniformly uses Xuid as the player's uniform identifier, rather than the common identifiers used elsewhere. For a player pointer `pl`, you can use `pl.xuid` to get his xuid string and pass it in as a parameter.
