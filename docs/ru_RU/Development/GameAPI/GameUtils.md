## ๐ฎ Game Utilities API

The following APIs provide some useful tool interfaces to help game content development, so that the development efficiency can be improved to a certain extent.

### Format Code Utility

MC provides format control capabilities such as color text, style modification, etc. in the game through the **formatting code** symbol. Formatting codes are divided into two types: color codes and format codes, which respectively provide color control and style control capabilities.

The interface here is to help developers quickly get started with MC formatting code, without frequently looking up the table to use
Note: The interface here will only have an effect when passed to the BDS and displayed.

```
```Lua
[Lua]
