# üé® LLSE - Game Element Interface Documentation

> The following APIs provide the ability to **modify** and **extension** game content.

Obviously, the game element interface is at the core of the entire plug-in system, which is related to the ability to control and expand game content.  
LLSE provides a rich and powerful interface of game elements to facilitate your creativity.

## üîÆ Game Element Objects

For the indexing of game elements, LLSE uses a special type of variable to keep track of each game element, and calls it "xx objects", such as "player objects" or "block objects".  
You can think of it as a unique identifier for a game element.   

Currently, LLSE has the following game element objects:

| Object Type Name | Object Name     | Purpose of Object                  |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `IntPos`         | Integer Coordinate Object  | Identifies integer location (like block coordinates)             |
| `FloatPos`       | Floating Point Coordinate Object | Identifies a floating point position (like entity coordinates)          |
| `DirectionAngle` | Direction Object| Identifies angle information (such as the direction a player is facing)       |
| `Player`         | Player Object | Identify player or access player attributes       |
| `Entity`         | Entity Object | Identify entity or access entity attributes      |
| `Block`          | Block Object  | Identify Block or access block attributes |
| `Item`           | Item Object  | Identifies an item in an inventory |
| `Container`      | Container Object | Identifies a container that can store items|
| `BlockEntity`    | Block Entity Object| Identifies a block entity |
| `Objective`      | Scoring Item Objective | Identifies the scoring items of a scoreboard system|

You will come across them frequently in subsequent documentation.

## üéØ Coordinate Object

In games, numerous APIs require coordinates.
The engine uses objects of type `IntPos` and `FloatPos` to indicate coordinates, called "coordinate objects".
Each member of the coordinate object is **readable and writable**.

1. `IntPos` object
    Its members are all **integers**, which are mostly used to represent **block coordinates** and other positions represented by integers.
    For a variable pos of type `IntPos`, there are the following members: 

   | Member    | Meaning    | Data Type       |
   | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
   | pos.x     | x coordinate     | `Integer` |
   | pos.y     | y coordinate     | `Integer` |
   | pos.z     | z coordinate     | `Integer` |
   | pos.dim   | Dimension name   | `String`  |
   | pos.dimid | Dimension ID     | `Integer` |

    Among them, the value of the **dimension ID** attribute is: `0` represents the Main World, `1` represents The Nether, and `2` represents The End.
    
    **Dimension text name:** The values of the attributes are: "Main World", "Nether", "End".

   If in some cases the dimension is invalid, or cannot be obtained, you will find that the value of `dimid` is `-1`.

   <br>

2. `FloatPos`object
    Its members are all **floating point numbers**, which are mostly used to represent **entity coordinates** and other positions that cannot be represented by integers  
    For a variable pos of type `FloatPos`, there are the following members:  

   | Member    | Meaning    | Data Type       |
   | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
   | pos.x     | x coordinate     | `Float`   |
   | pos.y     | y coordinate     | `Float`   |
   | pos.z     | z coordinate     | `Float`   |
   | pos.dim   | Dimension Name   | `String`  |
   | pos.dimid | Dimension ID     | `Integer` |

   Among them, the value of the **dimension ID** attribute is: `0` represents The Main World, `1` represents The Nether, and `2` represents The End.
   
   **Dimension text name:** The values of the attributes are: "Main World", "Nether", "End"

   If in some case the dimension is invalid, or cannot be obtained, you will find that the value of `dimid` is `-1`.

### Coordinate Object Auxiliary Interface

For scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat naturally support object-oriented, you can directly construct the coordinate object and pass in the x, y, z, dimid parameters.
For some languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat support general object orientation, LLSE also provides auxiliary interfaces to help generate a coordinate object more easily.

#### Generate an Integer Coordinate Object

`mc.newIntPos(x,y,z,dimid)` [static]

- Parameters: 
  - x : `Integer`  
    x coordinate
  - y : `Integer`  
    y coordinate
  - z : `Integer`  
    z coordinate
  - dimid : `Integer`  
    Dimension ID: `0` representing the overworld, `1` represents The Nether, `2` represents The End.
- Return value: An Integer coordinate object.
- Return value type: `IntPos`

#### Generate a Floating Point Coordinate Object

`mc.newFloatPos(x,y,z,dimid)`

- Parameters: 
  - x : `Float`  
    x coordinate
  - y : `Float`  
    y coordinate
  - z : `Float`  
    z coordinate
  - dimid : `Integer`  
    Dimension ID: `0` representing the overworld, `1` represents The Nether, `2` represents The End.
- Return value: A floating point coordinate object.
- Return value type: `FloatPos`

## üìê Bearing Angle Object

The engine uses a `DirectionAngle` object to denote an Euler angle, called a "direction angle object".
Its two members are **floating point numbers**, which are mostly used to represent the direction data such as the orientation of the entity.
Each member of the direction angle object is **readable and writable**. 

For a `DirectionAngle` type variable ang, there are the following members:  

| Member    | Meaning       | Data Type      |
| --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ang.pitch | Pitch angle (-90¬∞ ~ 90¬∞)  | `Float` |
| ang.yaw   | Yaw angle (rotation angle) | `Float`   |

Since there is no concept of rotation in the entity system of MC, there is no data related to the rollover angle.

<br>

#### Convert Yaw Angle to Base Heading

`ang.toFacing()`

- Return value: The basic orientation indicated by the current bearing object.
- Return value type: `Integer`

The return value is `0-3`, representing the four basic orientations of **North, East, South, West**. Used to quickly determine the general direction an entity is facing.
