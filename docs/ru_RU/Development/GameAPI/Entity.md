## üéà Entity Object API

In LLSE, "entity objects" are used to manipulate and obtain information about an entity.

### In LLSE, ‚ÄúEntity Objects‚Äù Are Used to Manipulate and Obtain Information About an Entity. 

#### Get From Event or API

Obtain the entity object given by BDS by registering the **event listener** function, or calling some **returning entity object** functions.
For details, see [Event listener documentation - EventAPI](/en_US/Development/EventAPI/Listen.md)      

#### Get All Currently Loaded Entities

This function returns an array of entity objects, each of which corresponds to a loaded entity.

`mc.getAllEntities()`

- Return value: List of entity objects
- Return value type:  `Array<Entity,Entity,...>`

#### Spawn New Creature and Get Its Entity Object

Through this function, generate a new creature at the specified location and get its corresponding entity object.

`mc.spawnMob(name,pos)`  
`mc.spawnMob(name,x,y,z,dimid)`

- Parameters: 
  - name : `String`  
    The namespace name of the creature, such as `minectaft:creeper`
  - pos : `IntPos `/ `FloatPos`  
    A coordinate object of where the mob is spawned (or use x, y, z, dimid to determine where to spawn).
- Return value: The generated entity object.
- Return value type:  `Entity`
  - If the return value is `Null` it means that the generation failed 

> Note: Do not save an entity object **long-term**.
> When the entity corresponding to the entity object is destroyed, the corresponding entity object will become invalid. Therefore, if there is a need to operate an entity for a long time, please obtain the real-time entity object through the above methods.

<br>

#### Clone A Creature and Get Its Entity Object

Through this function, generate a new creature at the specified location and get its corresponding entity object.

`mc.cloneMob(entity,pos)`  
`mc.cloneMob(entity,x,y,z,dimid)`

- Parameters: 
  - entity : `Entity`  
    Need clone entity object
  - pos : `IntPos `/ `FloatPos`  
    A coordinate object of where the mob is spawned (or use x, y, z, dimid to determine where to spawn).
- Return value: The clone entity object.
- Return value type:  `Entity`
  - If the return value is `Null` it means that the generation failed 

> Note: Do not save an entity object **long-term**.
> When the entity corresponding to the entity object is destroyed, the corresponding entity object will become invalid. Therefore, if there is a need to operate an entity for a long time, please obtain the real-time entity object through the above methods.

### Entity Object - Properties

Every entity object contains some fixed object properties. for a specific entity object `en`, has the following properties:

| Attributes   | Meaning            | Data Type        |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| en.name      | Entity name           | `String`         |
| en.type      | Entity type name     | `String`         |
| en.id        | Entity's in-game ID     | `Integer`        |
| en.pos       | Entity's coordinates       | `FloatPos`       |
| en.blockPos  | The coordinates of the block the entity is standing on | `IntPos`         |
| en.maxHealth | Entity's maximum health     | `Integer`        |
| en.health    | Entity's current health     | `Integer`        |
| en.inAir     | Whether the entity is in the air   | `Boolean`        |
| en.inWater   | Whether the entity is in the water | `Boolean`        |
| en.speed     | Entity's current speed       | `Float`          |
| en.direction | Entity's orientation       | `DirectionAngle` |
| en.uniqueId  | Entity's unique identifier     | `String`         |

These object properties are read-only and cannot be modified.

For a detailed explanation of the **entity's current orientation** attribute, see the [Basic Game Interface Documentation](/en_US/Development/GameAPI/Basic.md)

### Entity Object - Function

Each entity object contains some member functions (member methods) that can be executed. for a specific entity object `en`, you can perform some operations on this entity through the following functions:

#### Teleport Entity to Specified Location

`en.teleport(pos)`  
`en.teleport(x,y,z,dimid)`

- Parameters: 
  - pos :`IntPos `/ `FloatPos`  
    Target position coordinates (or use x, y, z, dimid to determine entity position)
- Return value: Whether the teleport was successful or not.
- Return value type:  `Boolean`

<br>

#### Kill the Specified Entity  

`en.kill()`

- Return value: Whether the entity execution was successful.
- Return value type:  `Boolean`

<br>

#### Inflict Damage to Entities

`en.hurt(damage)`

- Parameters: 
  - damage : `Integer`  
    The amount of damage to deal to the entity.
- Return value: Whether the damage was dealt.
- Return value type:  `Boolean`

Note that the damage dealt here is real damage and cannot be reduced by protective equipment such as armor.

<br>

#### Set the Specified Entity on Fire

`en.setOnFire(time)`

- Parameters: 
  - time : `Integer`  
    Fire time, in seconds.
- Return value: Whether the fire was set.
- Return value type:  `Boolean`

<br>

#### Determine if an Entity Object Is a Player

`en.isPlayer()`

- Return value: Whether the current entity object is a player.
- Return value type:  `Boolean`

<br>

#### Convert Entity Object to Player Object

`en.toPlayer()`

- Return value: The converted `Player` object.
- Return value type:  `Player`
  - Returns `Null` if this entity object does not point to a player, or if the transition fails.

If the current entity object points to a player, you can use this function to convert the entity object to a player object to use more player-related APIs.

<br>

#### Determine Whether an Entity Object Is a Dropped Item Entity

`en.isItemEntity()`

- Return value: Whether the current entity object is a dropped item entity.
- Return value type:  `Boolean`

`en.toItem()`

- Return value: The obtained `Item` object.
- Return value type:  `Item`
  - If this entity object is not a drop entity, or if the acquisition fails, return `Null`

If the current entity object is a drop entity, you can use this function to get the item object in the drop entity to use more item-related APIs.

<br>
