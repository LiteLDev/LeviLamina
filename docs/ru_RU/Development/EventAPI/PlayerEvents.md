## üìú Listen Event List

Here is a list of the various events that LLSE supports listening for.

Tip: You can obtain relevant information about the game objects obtained by listening, such as the coordinates of the block, the name of the entity, and so on.  
At the same time, the member functions of these objects can also be called.

> Notice! Some of the callback parameters passed in may sometimes be Null, which requires a good judgment check when writing code.
