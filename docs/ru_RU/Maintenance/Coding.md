## ðŸŽ¯ Maintain the project and contribute code

Since Mojang will modify the code every time it updates the BDS, some underlying APIs that use the Hook mechanism will become invalid. Therefore, the loader also needs to be maintained continuously with the version update, otherwise many functions will gradually lose their effectiveness. 

Due to the need for strong technical capabilities for related maintenance, community talents in this area have been in a relatively scarce state. 
Therefore, if you are interested in participating in the maintenance of the project and contributing code, we are absolutely very welcoming.

### If you...

#### Have C++ development skills that are relatively lacking, but you would like to contribute to the project:

- You can actively develop plug-ins for LiteLoader, which is a great way to help by building the LiteLoader ecosystem.
- You can help modify and optimize the development documentation, propose the API you want and push it to the author, and give everyone some ideas for improvement.
- You can help publicize and promote LiteLoader so that more people can participate in this project, and you can also help newbies and answer their questions.

#### Have some C++ / script development ability, have used or are interested in learning how to use the ScriptX cross-language scripting engine:

- You can maintain the interface layer API of LiteLoader and LiteLoader scripting engine, fix certain problems, and propose improvements.
- You can help implement more infrastructure for LiteLoader and LiteLoader scripting engine, like a full network library, a full JSON parsing system, etc.

#### Have strong C++ development ability, and have some grasp of the underlying technology

- You can help maintain the C++ API part of LiteLoader and suggest solutions when problems are found.
- You can help to use IDA to parse the pdb symbol database and discover new available event points and API functions to add to LiteLoader.
- You can suggest improvements to our underlying mechanisms and help us put good ideas into practice.

#### Bottom-level developer / Algorithm competition master / Reverse wizard / Experienced developer

- You can deeply participate in the development and advancement of all aspects of the project, help optimize LiteLoaders's code and facilities, improve or even renovate the architecture.
- You can help to improve the underlying mechanism, improve operating efficiency, or contribute code to improve the algorithm of key parts.
- You can put forward your thoughts and ideas for the future development of LiteLoader, and be a guide for the future.
