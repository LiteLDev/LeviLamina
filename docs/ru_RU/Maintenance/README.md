Maybe, you are a big guy who has just come into contact with LLSE, you are very interested in its functions and architecture, and you want to do research;

Every developer and contributor who is interested in participating in the maintenance of the LiteLoader (ScriptEngine) project is welcome here! 
Without your contributions, LLSE would have lost a lot of energy and innovation.
