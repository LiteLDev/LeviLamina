##  ðŸ“± Device Information Object API

In LLSE, the "device information object" is used to manipulate and obtain information about the game device used by a player.

### Get a Device Info Object

#### Acquired by the Player

Get the **device information object** corresponding to a player through the `.getDevice` member function of the player object
See [Player Object API](/en_US/Development/GameAPI/Player.md)      

> Note: Do not save a device information object **long-term.**
> When the player corresponding to the device exits the game, the corresponding object will become invalid. Therefore, if there is a need to operate an object for a long time, please obtain the real-time device information object through the above methods.
