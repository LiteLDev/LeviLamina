## LiteLoaderBDS version support for Bedrock Dedicated Server
BDS's minor version updates are perfectly compatible  
For example: 2.1.2 is developed based on BDS 1.18.11.01, and its protocol version is 486. As long as the protocol version of subsequent versions of BDS (for example: 1.18.12.01) is still 486, LL can perfectly support it.  
We usually call a version update with no change in the protocol version as a minor version update (for example: 1.18.11.01 to 1.18.12.01), and if the protocol version is updated (such as 1.18.2 to 1.18.11.01), we call it a major version update  
The game version and protocol version will be showed when server started, you can also type `version` command to query it
