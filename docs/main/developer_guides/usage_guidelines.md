# LeviLamina Usage Guidelines

## PURPOSE

We love that our users and fans do cool things and share them with the community. Our goal is to create an environment where you get to do great things for the *LeviLamina* community without others coming along and spoiling it for everyone. We realize that some things you will create and share and other things you may create and sell. So, we wrote these guidelines to explain what we consider to be acceptable ways to use the *LeviLamina* name, brand, assets in your creation.

In short, we hope that these help you understand what you can and can't do and help you do and share more (and limit those that try to go too far).

### IMPORTANT LEGAL AGREEMENTS

[The LeviLamina End User License Agreement](../../EULA.md) (EULA) is a legal agreement between you and us ([*LiteLDev*](https://github.com/LiteLDev)). The EULA relates to your use of *LeviLamina* products and governs your use of our website and how we resolve disputes. It is your responsibility to understand and follow the EULA.

The guidelines presented here should be followed alongside the EULA. They do not form part of the EULA. Rather, they exist because we currently believe it is a good idea to allow some leniency in the use of LeviLamina.

## ALL USES

In relation to all uses (permitted or otherwise):

- All rights (including copyright, trademark rights, and related rights) in the name, brand, assets, and any derivatives are and will remain owned by *LiteLDev*.
- All permissions and consents are given at our discretion and may be revoked at any time if we think that it is appropriate to do so, or if we don't like what you are doing.
- All rights are expressly reserved.
If you are interested in proposing a formal partnership with us, please maintain that interest, as we are currently **not** considering partnerships with other individuals, organizations, companies, etc. If you wish to report violations of these guidelines, you can send us information about the violation through [our website](feedback@levimc.org). We are **not** able to give advice about whether a specific project does or does **not** comply with these guidelines. If you are unsure, you should speak to an attorney for help.

More guidelines will follow as we decide what and when to add them - so feel free to make requests.

## ESSENTIAL GUIDELINES

We want to make it clear that these are the basic guidelines that apply to your **prohibited** uses of our name, brand, and assets. You should still read all policies and guidelines in full, but here is a brief summary of the key points to help guide you.

If you use any part of any name, brand, or asset, then:

**Do not** engage in any activities or include any content that might lead people to believe that the content you share could be construed as official, or approved, endorsed, associated with, supported by, or related to us.

- **Do not** engage in any unlawful, misleading, obscene, harmful, or offensive activities.
- **Do not** engage in any activities that could damage or undermine our name, brand, or assets (for example: gambling, pornography, violence, terrorism, or other unsafe/adult content).
- **Do not** redistribute our products or any modifications of our products or product documentation.
- **Do not** allow unfair or unreasonable access to any content created by us.
- **Do not** impersonate *LiteLDev*/appear to be associated with or supported by *LiteLDev*, and explicitly state:
  - You (rather than us) are responsible for the products or services (including events, servers, books, and handmade items).
  - Who the publisher, manufacturer, seller, organizer, and/or owner is.
  - The contact and contact information for products, services, or any related purchases (chat and forum links are not acceptable).
- Attempting to obtain any data that violates the [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) or could harm the security of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) by dumping [*LeviLamina*](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) or any of [our other products](https://github.com/orgs/LiteLDev/repositories) (hereinafter referred to as "**LeviLamina**:, See the first entry under "**DEFINITIONS**" for more details.) is unwise!
- **Do not** attempt to reverse *LeviLamina* for malicious purposes!
- We do **not** want you to use *LeviLamina* to develop any programs that could compromise the security of Minecraft, or any other products that we deem to compromise Minecraft's security.

Include a disclaimer in a prominent position on your products, listings, descriptions, websites/pages, and all other related materials that states: "Not an official *LiteLDev* product [product/service/event/etc.]. Not approved by *LiteLDev* and not associated with *LiteLDev*."

These guidelines are intended to help you understand what we do and do not want to happen when you use our name, brand, and assets in your work. We aim to be as open, honest, and, most importantly, trustworthy as possible. We hope you will treat us in the same way.

## NAMING GUIDELINES

You may use our name in connection with your product or service, title, or listing (including on websites, video platforms, or merchandise) if you follow the guidelines in this section.

If you:

- Use the *LeviLamina* name as a secondary name, secondary title, or description because it is necessary to describe your creations or their purpose honestly and fairly
- Ensure that the secondary title (which includes the *LeviLamina* name) is not the dominant element or the distinctive part of the complete name or title
- Don't use any other aspect of our brand or assets as part of any related branding, including as a logo or part of a logo
- Don't use our name as keywords or search tags for products that have no relationship with them or that are infringing or counterfeit

Then you may use the *LeviLamina* name.

## PERSONAL USE

We are very relaxed about things you create for yourself. Pretty much anything goes there - so go for it and have fun, just remember the policies and **avoid any illegal activities (such as writing cheats), infringing on others' rights, or violating the Minecraft EULA.**

If you decide you want to share your creation with the community, you may do so. In fact, we are excited for you and can't wait to see what you've been doing. When you decide to share your content with the community (whether you plan to make money off it or not), we consider that a commercial activity. When you engage in commercial activities, you must follow the Commercial Use guidelines.

This applies, for example, if you want to set up and run any non-commercial blogs, servers, community forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events, and gatherings.

## COMMERCIAL USE

We are less relaxed about using our name, brand, and assets for commercial use. While we love that you want to share your creations with the community and understand that you may want to charge others, we do have some limits regarding what we consider acceptable *LeviLamina* commercial use.

In these guidelines, commercial use means any use of our name, brand, or assets that you use and share with others (regardless of whether you receive payment or provide it for free). This can be through videos and streams you create, merchandise you make, or even a server you host. We may change this definition over time, but for now, we hope this helps you understand what you can and can't do, helping you and other fans like you create more while limiting those who try to overstep.

-----------------------------------------------

***We are currently drafting this section of the guidelines, and commercial use is not permitted until this section is published.***

## IN SUMMARY

We love the idea of you, our community, doing cool things and want to support your creativity. We understand that you may want to share your creations with others and even make money off what you've created. We want to empower you to create and share. At the same time, we want to limit those who would take things too far. Hopefully, these guidelines help you understand what we are okay with you doing and what we aren't.

If something isn't covered by these guidelines and we haven't otherwise said it's okay, that probably means we don't want you to do it. In any case, if it isn't covered, please don't do it without getting written permission from us. If something is specifically covered and permitted by these guidelines, our account terms, or [End User License Agreement](../../EULA.md) applicable to any of our games, then you don't need to contact us.
