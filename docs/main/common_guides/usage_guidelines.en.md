# LeviLamina Usage Guidelines

This document is intended only as a **translation** of the usage guidelines, the original text being the **Chinese version**. In other words, if there is a conflict between this document and the Chinese version, **the Chinese version shall prevail**. In addition, since this document is a translated version and may not be updated in a timely manner**, we recommend that you check the Chinese version to ensure that you are **aware** of updates.

## Purpose

We really enjoy seeing our users and fans do cool things and share them with the community. Our goal is to create an environment where you can make great contributions to the *LeviLamina* community while ensuring others do not spoil the experience for everyone. We recognize that some of the content you create and share is for the community, while other content may be something you create and sell. Therefore, we have established these guidelines to explain how to use the *LeviLamina* name, brand, and assets in your creations.

In short, we hope these guidelines help you understand what you can and cannot do, helping you create and share more, while limiting those who might cross the line.

### Important Legal Agreements

[The LeviLamina End User License Agreement](../../../EULA.en.md) (EULA) is a legal agreement between you and us ([*Levimc*](https://github.com/Levimc)). The EULA covers your use of *LeviLamina* products and governs your use of our website and how we resolve disputes. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the EULA.

These guidelines should be followed alongside the EULA but do not form part of the EULA. They exist because we currently believe that allowing some flexibility in the use of *LeviLamina* is a good idea.

## All Uses

For all uses (whether permitted or not):

- All rights (including copyright, trademark rights, and related rights) in the name, brand, assets, and any derivatives remain owned by *Levimc* and will always be retained.
- All permissions and consents are granted at our discretion and may be revoked at any time if we deem it appropriate or if we do not like what you are doing.
- All rights are expressly reserved.

If you are interested in proposing a formal partnership with us, please maintain that interest, as we are currently **not** considering partnerships with other individuals, organizations, companies, etc. If you wish to report a violation of these guidelines, you can send us information through [our email](feedback@levimc.org). We **cannot** provide advice on whether a specific project complies with these guidelines. If you are unsure, you should consult with a lawyer for assistance.

We will add more guidelines as we decide when and what to include—feel free to make requests.

## Essential Guidelines

We want to make it clear that these are the basic guidelines for **prohibited** uses of our name, brand, and assets. You should still read all policies and guidelines in full, but here is a brief summary of the key points to help guide you.

If you use any part of any name, brand, or asset, then:

**Do not** engage in any activities or include any content that might lead people to believe that the content you share could be construed as official, approved, endorsed, associated with, supported by, or related to us.

- **Do not** engage in any unlawful, misleading, obscene, harmful, or offensive activities.
- **Do not** engage in any activities that could damage or undermine our name, brand, or assets (for example: gambling, pornography, violence, terrorism, or other unsafe/adult content).
- **Do not** redistribute our products or any modifications of our products or product documentation.
- **Do not** allow unfair or unreasonable access to any content created by us.
- **Do not** impersonate *Levimc* or appear to be associated with or supported by *Levimc*, and explicitly state:
  - You (rather than us) are responsible for the products or services (including events, servers, books, and handmade items).
  - Who the publisher, manufacturer, seller, organizer, and/or owner is.
  - The contact and contact information for products, services, or any related purchases (chat and forum links are not acceptable).
- Attempting to obtain any data that violates the [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) or could harm the security of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) by dumping [*LeviLamina*](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina) or any of [our other products](https://github.com/orgs/LiteLDev/repositories) (see the first entry under "**DEFINITIONS**" for more details) is unwise!
- **Do not** attempt to reverse *LeviLamina* for malicious purposes!
- We do **not** want you to use *LeviLamina* to develop any programs that could compromise Minecraft's security, or any other products that we consider to be a threat to Minecraft's security.

Include a disclaimer in a prominent position on your products, listings, descriptions, websites/pages, and all other related materials stating: "Not an official *Levimc* product [product/service/event/etc.]. Not approved by *Levimc* and not associated with *Levimc*."

These guidelines are designed to help you understand what we do and do not want to happen when you use our name, brand, and assets. We aim to be as open, honest, and, most importantly, trustworthy as possible. We hope you will treat us the same way.

## Naming Guidelines

You may use our name in connection with your product or service, title, or listing (including on websites, video platforms, or merchandise) if you follow the guidelines in this section.

If you:

- Use the *LeviLamina* name as a secondary name, secondary title, or description because it is necessary to honestly and fairly describe your creations or their purpose.
- Ensure that the secondary title (which includes the *LeviLamina* name) is not the dominant element or distinctive part of the complete name or title.
- Do not use any other aspect of our brand or assets as part of any related branding, including as a logo or part of a logo.
- Do not use our name as keywords or search tags for products that have no relationship with them or that are infringing or counterfeit.

Then you may use the *LeviLamina* name.

## Personal Use

We are very relaxed about things you create for yourself. Pretty much anything goes, so go ahead and have fun—just remember to follow the policies and **avoid any illegal activities (such as writing cheats), infringing on others' rights, or violating the Minecraft EULA.**

If you decide you want to share your creation with the community, you can do so. In fact, we are excited for you and can’t wait to see what you've been creating. When you decide to share your content with the community (whether you plan to make money off it or not), we consider that a commercial activity. When you engage in commercial activities, you must follow the Commercial Use guidelines.

This applies, for example, if you want to set up and run any non-commercial blogs, servers, community forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events, and gatherings.

## Commercial Use

We are stricter about using our name, brand, and assets for commercial use. While we love that you want to share your creations with the community and understand that you may want to charge others, we do have some limits regarding what we consider acceptable *LeviLamina* commercial use.

In these guidelines, commercial use means any use of our name, brand, or assets that you use and share with others (whether or not you receive payment or provide it for free). This can be through videos and streams you create, merchandise you make, or even a server you host. We may change this definition over time, but for now, we hope this helps you understand what you can and can’t do, helping you and other fans like you create more while limiting those who try to overstep.

Currently, we follow the commercial use guidelines of Minecraft’s usage rules.

## Summary

We love the idea of you, as part of our community, doing cool things, and we want to support your creativity. We understand that you may want to share your creations with others and even make money off what you've created. We want to empower you to create and share. At the same time, we want to limit those who would take things too far. Hopefully, these guidelines help you understand what we are okay with you doing and what we aren’t.

If something isn’t covered by these guidelines and we haven’t explicitly said it’s okay, it probably means we don’t want you to do it. In any case, if it isn’t covered, please don’t do it without getting written permission from us. If something is specifically covered and permitted by these guidelines, our account terms, or the [End User License Agreement](../../../EULA.en.md) applicable to any of our games, then you don’t need to contact us.
