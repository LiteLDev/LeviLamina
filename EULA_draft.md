### DEFINITIONS

To be clear, when we refer to:

- Our name (or the *LeviLamina* name), we mean the name of any one of our games, taglines,features, events, or company identity. We also mean any names which are confusingly similar to our name
- Our brand, we mean any names, related logos, fonts, textures, and any other distinctive characteristics of any part of our name and games
- Our assets, we mean the code, software, graphics, textures, images, models, sounds and other audio from any of our games and any videos or screenshots taken from our games

### WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH LEVILAMINA SOFTWARE AND CONTENT

We are quite relaxed about what you do-actually, we strongly encourage you to do cool things-but please don't do the things we've said you can't. We've put together detailed [*LeviLamina* usage guidelines](docs/main/developer_guides/usage_guidelines_draft.md) outlining what you can or cannot do with the content we've created. These [*LeviLamina* usage guidelines](docs/main/developer_guides/usage_guidelines_draft.md) may change frequently, and we reserve the right to withdraw these permissions.

### DEVELOPING MODS

Programs you modify using *LeviLamina* related to Minecraft are collectively referred to as "**MODS**." Here, "MODS" refers to original content created by you or others that **does not** contain a substantial part of our copyrightable code or content. We have **final authority** on what constitutes a MOD and what does not. We hope you will **not** use MODS for griefing. **Generally**, MODS can be distributed; however, modified versions **cannot** be distributed.

Any MODS you create from scratch using *LeviLamina* for Minecraft belong to you (including pre-run MODS and in-memory MODS), and you can handle them as you wish, as long as you **comply with this EULA**. Remember, MODS refer to your **original** works that **do not contain** a substantial part of our code or content. You **only** own what you create, and **do not own** our code or content.

When we update *LeviLamina*, some changes may not be compatible with other software, such as MODS. This is unfortunate, but we **do not take responsibility** for it. If this happens, please try running an older version.

To ensure the integrity of our products, we need all game downloads and updates to come from authorized sources. We also prefer that third-party tools/services **do not** appear "official," as we cannot guarantee their quality. This is part of our responsibility to *LeviLamina* customers. Please ensure you also **carefully** read our EULA, as we may **remove** MODS or other software that violate the EULA.

### CONTENT

Your content remains your content; we **do not** own the ***original things*** you create. However, we will own copies (or substantial copies) or derivatives of our property and creations - but if you create original things, they are not ours.

### OUR VALUES

The spirit of **inclusion** lives in our values, which are key to sustaining a vibrant and welcoming community.

- *LeviLamina* is for **everyone**
- Diversity powers our community
- Playing with others should be **safe and inclusive**
- **Hate has no place here**

### LEVILAMINA IS FOR EVERYONE, AND DIVERSITY POWERS OUR COMMUNITY

*LeviLamina* is available in multiple countries around the world, and it's important that our platform feels safe and inclusive for people from all backgrounds. Every user in the *LeviLamina* community deserves a place to be their authentic selves and to build, craft, create, and express themselves in an environment that is inclusive to all. We aspire to be a community where everyone can enjoy *LeviLamina*.

The *LeviLamina* community belongs to you, but it also belongs to everyone else. When you express your opinions, please do so with **politeness** and **respect** - don't blow up like a creeper!

### USER RESPONSIBILITY

It is the responsibility of every *LeviLamina* user to report inappropriate behavior in the community. Users can report misconduct through [our website](feedback@levimc.org).

### PLAYING WITH OTHERS SHOULD BE SAFE AND INCLUSIVE, AND HATE HAS NO PLACE HERE

To keep the *LeviLamina* community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, we have a **zero-tolerance policy** towards hate speech, terrorist or violent extremist content, bullying, harassment, sexual solicitation, fraud, or threatening others. The mods and other content you create using *LeviLamina* can be a great way to showcase what matters to you and express your creativity. However, content that portrays hate, extreme bias, or encourages illegal activity is not permitted.

Fraud is any attempt to use deceit or misrepresentation for personal or financial gain. When someone commits fraud, they circumvent the processes that keep things fair and financially secure for everyone.

### GENERAL TERMS

The laws of your country may grant you rights that this EULA **cannot change**; if so, this EULA will apply **to the extent permitted by law**.

We may occasionally update this EULA, such as due to changes in our products, practices, or legal obligations, but these changes will only take effect **to the extent they are legally applicable**. In such cases, we will push updates on our GitHub, so please check it regularly to stay informed. We won’t act unfairly regarding these changes—however, sometimes laws change, or someone’s actions impact other users, and we need to address it.

If you make a suggestion about *LeviLamina*, that suggestion is provided for free, and we have **no obligation to accept or consider** it. This means we can use or not use your suggestion in any way, **without compensation**. If you believe a suggestion is worth payment, do not share it with us unless you first notify us of your expectation for payment, and we have agreed in writing and requested the suggestion.

If you wish to notify us of intellectual property infringement in our services, please submit your notice here. We reserve the right to remove any content at our discretion.
