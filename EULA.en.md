### Introduction

By using [*LeviLamina*](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina), you explicitly agree to the terms of this EULA and the [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula). If you are a minor and have difficulty understanding these terms and conditions, please have your parents or legal guardians explain them to you, as your parents or legal guardians will accept these terms on your behalf.

If you agree to the terms and conditions of this EULA, you agree to use *LeviLamina* only in accordance with this EULA, and you agree to be bound by these terms and become a party to this agreement. If you are agreeing to this agreement on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity (**"Company"**), then (i) "you" includes both you and the Company, (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the Company and have the authority to bind the Company to this EULA.

If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this EULA, or if you do not have the legal capacity, or you are not an authorized representative of a company to sign this EULA, do not download, install, access, or otherwise use *LeviLamina*, and do not click any button or other mechanism intended to confirm acceptance of the terms.

In specific cases, this EULA may include additional licensing terms or specific terms provided when browsing the *Levimc* website, ordering, installing, downloading, accessing, or using any *Levimc* software. If there is a conflict between this EULA and these additional terms, the additional terms will take precedence. You agree to fully comply with the EULA.

*Levimc* reserves the right to modify this EULA at any time. Your continued use of *LeviLamina* after receiving notice of a change constitutes your acceptance of the modification.

### Definitions

For clarity, when we refer to:

- Our name (or the name of *LeviLamina*), we mean the name of any of our games, products, slogans, features, events, or company logos. We also refer to any name that is similar to or might cause confusion with our name.
- Our brand, refers to any name, logo, font, texture, or other distinctive features related to our name and games.
- Our assets, refers to any code, software, graphics, textures, images, models, sounds, and other audio in our game, as well as any video or screenshots extracted from our game.

### What You Can and Cannot Do: LEVILAMINA Software and Content

We are relatively permissive about what you can do, in fact, we strongly encourage you to do cool things—but please do not do anything we have explicitly prohibited. We have prepared detailed [*LeviLamina* Usage Guidelines](docs/main/common_guides/usage_guidelines.md), which outline what you can or cannot do. These [*LeviLamina* Usage Guidelines](docs/main/common_guides/usage_guidelines.md) may change frequently, and we reserve the right to revoke these permissions.

### Developing Mods

Programs modified using *LeviLamina* related to Minecraft are collectively referred to as "**MODS**". Here, "MODS" refers to original content created by you or others, **not including** substantial parts of our copyrighted code or content. We have the **final judgment** on what constitutes a MOD and what does not. We hope you **do not** use MODS for destructive purposes. **Typically**, MODs can be distributed; however, modified versions **cannot** be distributed.

Mods you create from scratch using *LeviLamina* belong to you (including pre-running mods and mods in memory), and you may handle these mods as you wish, as long as you **comply with this EULA**. Remember, a MOD refers to **original** works you create, **not including** substantial parts of our code or content. You **only own** the content you create, and **do not own** our code or content.

When we update *LeviLamina*, certain changes may not be compatible with other software (such as MODs). While unfortunate, we **are not liable** for this. If this happens, please try running an earlier version.

To ensure the integrity of our product, we require all downloads and updates to come from authorized sources. We also prefer that third-party tools/services **do not** appear “official,” as we cannot guarantee their quality. This is part of our responsibility to *LeviLamina* users. Please make sure you **carefully** read our EULA, as we may **remove** MODs or other software that violates the EULA.

### Content

Your content remains your content; we **do not** own your **original works**. However, we will own copies (or substantial copies) or derivatives of our property and creations—but if you create original content, it does not belong to us.

### Our Values

**Inclusivity** is at the core of our values, and these values are essential to maintaining a vibrant and welcoming community.

- *LeviLamina* is for **everyone**.
- Diversity is the strength of our community.
- Playing with others should be **safe and inclusive**.
- **Hate has no place here**.

### LEVILAMINA Serves Everyone, and Diversity Empowers Our Community

*LeviLamina* serves multiple countries/regions around the world, and we want our platform to make people from diverse backgrounds feel safe and included. Every *LeviLamina* community user should have a place to express their true self, and a space to build, create, and express in an environment open to everyone. We want to create a community where everyone can enjoy *LeviLamina*.

The *LeviLamina* community belongs to you, but also to everyone. When you express your views, please be **polite** and **respectful**—don’t explode like a creeper!

### User Responsibility

Every *LeviLamina* user is responsible for reporting misconduct within the community. Users can report misconduct through [Email](feedback@levimc.org).

### Playing Together Should Be Safe and Inclusive, and Hate Has No Place Here

To keep the *LeviLamina* community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, we have a **zero-tolerance policy** for hate speech, terrorism or extreme violence content, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, fraud, or threatening behavior. MODs and other content you create using *LeviLamina* can be a great way to showcase your concerns and express creativity. However, content that expresses hate, extreme prejudice, or encourages illegal activities is not allowed.

Fraud refers to any act of personal or financial gain through deception or false statements. When someone commits fraud, they bypass the procedures designed to maintain fairness and financial security.

### General Terms

Your country's laws may grant you rights under this EULA that **cannot be altered**; if so, this EULA will apply **to the extent permitted by law**.

We may occasionally update this EULA based on changes to our products, practices, or legal obligations, but these changes will only take effect **to the extent permitted by law**. In such cases, we will post updates on GitHub, so please check regularly to stay informed. We will not take unfair actions on these changes—however, sometimes laws change, or someone's actions affect other users, and we need to address this.

If you provide a suggestion for *LeviLamina*, it is offered freely, and we are **under no obligation to accept or consider** it. This means we can choose whether or not to use your suggestion, **without compensation**. If you believe a suggestion deserves compensation, do not share it with us until we have agreed upon it in writing.

If you wish to notify us about intellectual property infringement in our services, please submit a notification here. We reserve the right to remove any content at our discretion.

If you violate this EULA, the consequences are **entirely your responsibility**, whether as an individual, organization, or company.
